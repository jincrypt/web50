Styling of new post and all posts

all posts
- Likes (initially 0)

Profile page
- clicking on username should load user profile page (posts, top, etc)
- display number of followers the user has
- display number of people that user follows 
- display all posts for that user in reverse chronological order
- if user is not owner, there should be a toggable follow/unfollow button (cannot follow yourself)

Following
- following link brings you to a page where they see all posts made by users that you follow
- page behaves the same as "All Posts" with more limited set of posts (see email?)


Pagination
- 10 posts per page
- next, previous only in specs

Edit Posts
- edit own posts
- content of post changes to text area where you can edit right away
- should be able to see a save button after
- no need to reload entire page
- ensure user == owner (noone else cna forcefully edit)

Like/Unlike
- like + Unlike
- using javascript, asynchronously let the server know ot update the like count via fetch? and update the post's like count displayed on page without reloading the entire page.
